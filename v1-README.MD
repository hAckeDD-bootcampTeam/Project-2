A playground for users to store, sort, and find information relating to Bookmarks and information in general. For programmers, this information can include code repositories and snippets as well.

## Heroku Link

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Clone the Cache-It repository (https://github.com/...../Cache-It.git) and then create a MySQL database called cache-it_db.

### NPM Dependencies

* bcrypt: 3.0.0
* bcrypt-nodejs: 0.0.3
* body-parser: 1.16.0

## Step-by-Step

* Update the settings in the "config.json" file for the database connection

* Run => "npm install" in the terminal to install the dependecies from the package.json file
* Run => "node server" in the terminal to start the server and connect to the database
* Visit localhost: 8080

## What the app does?

```
Reddit API 
```
  
  The app récupère the five most recent and voted posts on reddit.com, based on the user's interests. How does it work? The user types the keyword(s) of interest in the search box, and the app lists the five most recent and voted posts on reddit.com, including post title and the date it was created, and links to view the posts, the reddit link and the source link.
